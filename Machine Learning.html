    Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of the study of artificial intelligence, “using statistical techniques progressively to improve a computer system’s ability in performing a specific task”, such as image recognition, without explicit programming. As defined by Tom M. Mitchell, in Machine Learning, “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E”.

    There are different methods and approaches to implement Machine Learning, one of the most common approach being artificial neural networks. These “consist of artificial nodes that mimic human neurons by forming connections and exchanging information”. To train the network, pre classified sample inputs (supervised Machine Learning) are fed into the system; “the network then learns to classify the samples by adjusting the relative weights assigned to relative features”. The network can get increasingly better at distinguishing images the more training data it is given.
