i. Interest of content - Very Good
The introductory page was interesting and made you want to read the other webpages. The authors seem very passionate about the
content and it was clear a lot of research had gone into writing the webpages. 

ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Good
The style of the webpages were consistent, with the exception of the ’Overview’ page, some of the headers contain images whereas 
some do not. The overall presentation is good, however somewhat simple. Some of the font styles differ also.

iii. Quality of written presentation - Good
Some of the sentences were difficult to understand on certain webpages. The content is interesting but it would have been better 
if it had linked back to the question ’How does Computer Science make a positive contribution to society’.

iv. Validity of HTML - Very Good
HTML is well laid out however some of the links are pasted into <p> tags instead of creating a hyperlink using <a> tags. 

v. Evidence of collaboration including - Sound
Author information was not included in the webpage, only links to the author’s GitHub profile. All members of the group have 
contributed however some members have made more commits than others. Most of the commits were also directly uploaded to GitHub 
instead of using the command line.
