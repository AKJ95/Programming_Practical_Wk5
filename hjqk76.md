Interest of content:
Very good - This group picked very interesting topics and wrote about exciting things within them. AI in particular was the most interesting.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
Very good - All the pages have a consistent style and visual presentation. The quality of the pages varies very little. Seems to be a small problem with the pages not displaying .png files, which causes the smartphone page to not be as good as it could have been.

Quality of written presentation:
Good - 

Validity of HTML:
Excellent - I'm no authority on good html code, but this seems to be very valid. Not sure what is stopping the .png files from displaying but it doesn't look like anything is wrong with the html.

Evidence of collaboration:
Good-Everyone did similar workloads and collaborated well. Author info is missing so cannot have been done by other members. Some commits were 'last minute' and most of the work was done within the last 12 hours, but this isn't so much a problem.
